Issues to be resolved before a first release:
- Doxygen
- Fix all the TODOs in the source code
- Currently none of the ErrorCode values are specified. Put an enum somewhere.
- It is not clear if a session header is required or desired in order to connect to a master gateway
- Not a single test was perfomed yet together with a master gateway
- Due to the "clean room" approach, the config protocol may require changes



Issues to be resolved after the first release:
- None yet
